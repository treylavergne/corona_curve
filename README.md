# CoronaCurve

This is a Ruby CLI Gem I built during my time at Flatiron School. This application accepts a user's input and returns upcoming launch missions in order to escape COVID-19.

Here's my video walkthrough: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzJQWuLmnx0

## What I Learned

* Solidified knowledge of an object creation upon instatiantion
* Integrated external API data, iterated through it to display relevant fields, and learned how to scrape a website in the process
* Enhanced UI by requiring the Colorize gem and formatted Terminal text with Bash commands
* Gained deeper understanding of conditionals and how just how DRY while loops can make my code
* Understood and appreciated the value of an in-depth flow chart the further I got into build out


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'corona_curve'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install corona_curve

## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
